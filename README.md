Project Description

[‘Eli Finder’ is a fun, interactive web app that tracks your pointer’s position, speed, and distance traveled in real-time. It adds playful alerts, cursor changes, and a global ‘mouse lost’ counter to turn simple mouse movement into pure entertainment.]

 The Problem (that doesn't exist)

[In a world where computer mice frequently attempt daring escapes from their screens, users are left clueless about their pointer’s whereabouts and fitness levels.]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

[Our mission: to track, tame, and train these mischievous mice before they run a marathon across the monitor border.We’ve built a high-tech, over-engineered React web app that uses radar visuals, fake alerts, and totally unnecessary metrics to track your mouse’s every move. From pinpointing its exact location to measuring its ‘daily workout,’ we make sure your pointer never goes unnoticed—solving a problem that never existed in the first place.]

Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- [HTML,CSS,JAVA]
- [React]
- [Firebase]


Implementation
For Software:

[Armed with React, Firebase, and way too much free time, we crafted a masterpiece of digital overkill. We attached a live mouse radar, built a Lost & Found panic button, measured pointer speed like it’s training for the Olympics, and even threw in fake error pop-ups for dramatic flair. Every mouse wiggle is logged in a global database—because somewhere, someone needs to know your cursor just moved 2 centimeters]
